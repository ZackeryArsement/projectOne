## Overview:

Let's Get Outta Here is a travel application that helps people find the perfect escape for the day or a long weekend. 

Inspired by the stir-crazy conditions of pandemic lockdowns and self-isolation at home, our user-friendly website streamlines the task of scouring the internet for the crucial information you need to plan your next getaway. 

Simply enter your current city and choice of travel - Daytrip or Weekend Getaway - and our application will generate a list of possible destinations, including a description of each locale, weather forecast and a map with directions to get you on your way. 

A "favorites" toolbar also lets you save trip options so you can keep track of all the great places you want to explore as well as those worthy of return visits.
